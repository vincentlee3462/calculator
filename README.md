This is my first repository on github and also my first project. 
This is a simple calculator and it can calculate some simple calculations with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
It took me three days to finish it, and most of the JavaScript is only the basic functions and methods. Therefore, it may take a huge amount of computer resources to do calculations.
Also, there may be some bugs in this calculator. I may fix them later if I am free.
