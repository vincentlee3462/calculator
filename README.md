## Description
This is my first repository on github and also my first project. <br>
This is a simple calculator and it can calculate some simple calculations with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. <br>
It took me three days to finish it, and most of the JavaScript is only the basic functions and methods. <br>
Therefore, it may take a huge amount of computer resources to do calculations. <br>
Also, there may be some bugs in this calculator. I may fix them later when I am free. <br>
